# Hello, I am Mirjam

## This is my portfolio :information_desk_person:
It's a work in progress project that I update and improve iteratively. At least, that's the plan!

### First things first
I would be happy if you pay my portfolio at [programmiri.de](http://www.programmiri.de/) a visit. Feel free to get in touch if you have feedback about it.

The portfolio is currently based on a brunch setup I build as an example for two article of mine. Visit the my repository [brunch-setup-bootstrap4](https://github.com/programmiri/brunch-setup-bootstrap4) if you want to learn more about it.

#### Program-what?
*Programmiri* is a old nickname a friend gave me when I build my first website. It's a wordplay with the words "Programming" and "Miri" (for Mirjam). It's not very original, but it kind of stucked  `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
